<h3>Concussion Facts</h3>
<ul>-Most sport-related concussions (more than 90%) occur without loss of consciousness.</ul>
<ul>-Research suggests that 80-90% of concussions will resolve within 7-10 days; however some athletes who sustain a concussion may have symptoms that last for weeks, months, or even longer.</ul>
<ul>-Kids generally require longer recovery time after sustaining a concussion due to the fact that their brains are still developing.</ul>
<ul>-Signs/symptoms of a concussion may not show up until several hours or days after the injury occurs.</ul>
<ul>-After suffering a concussion, an athlete is 3-6 times more susceptible to suffer another concussion compared to an athlete who has not suffered a concussion</ul>
<ul>-If an athlete is not fully healed from the first concussion and suffers a second concussion, recovery can be prolonged or the likelihood of having long-lasting effects can occur. In very rare cases, brain swelling, permanent brain damage, and even death can occur.</ul>
<ul>-Current research suggests that there is approximately 1.6 to 3.8 million recreational and sport-related concussions each year in the U.S. and the number of people being treated for these injuries has increased greatly in recent years.</ul>
<ul>-At least 25% of concussion sufferers fail to get assessed by medical personnel.</ul>
<ul>-Immediate consequences include headache, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, fatigue, or unconsciousness.</ul>
<ul>-As noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, other causes of concussions include motor vehicle accidents, falls, assaults and blunt force trauma.</ul>

<h3>What is CTE?</h3>
<p>Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy is a brain disease that is caused by repetitive brain trauma.<br /> It is commonly found in athletes and military veterans. CTE has been seen in people as young <br />as 17 years old, but the major symptoms do not usually appear until years after the head trauma. <br />Early symptoms of CTE usually appear in a patient's late 20's or 30's, and can mildly or drastically <br/>change someone's mood or behavior. Common changes include impulse control problems, aggression, <br/>depression, and paranoia. </p>
<h3>Fred McNeill</h3>
<p>An example of the cause and effects of CTE is former NFL player Fred McNeill. <br/>After McNeill died his brain was examined and it was discovered that he had CTE. <br/>When Fred was alive his symptoms were described as transforming from a loving family man to a <br/>person who struggled with memory loss, anger, and depression all because of the constant head trauma <br/>he suffered while playing football. </p>
<h3>The NFL Is Trying To Prevent Concussions</h3>
<p>Concussions are a very serious issue in the NFL right now. To prevent them, the NFL issued a concussion protocol<br/> for when a player shows signs of suffering one during a game. </p>
<h4>In Game Concussion Protocol Checklist</h4>
<ul><p>1. Team trainers will request and review video of the play identified by the trigger with UNC teammate.</p></ul>
<ul><p>2. At a minimum, assess the player by performing a focused neurological examination
that includes: (i) asking what happened; (ii) reviewing the “Go/No-Go” signs and
symptoms; and (iii) asking the Maddock’s questions on the sideline. The Team
physician/UNC team will be assembled for this evaluation2
. If after performing the
above evaluations and reviewing the video there remains any doubt as to whether a
concussion has occurred, then the full NFL Sideline Concussion Assessment will
be performed by the Team Physician/ATC/UNC team in the locker room. Whether
or not the locker room assessment is warranted is in the sole discretion of the Team
Physician concussion expert.</p></ul>
<ul><p>3. The Team Physician will consult in private with his/her concussion team members,
the UNC and, as necessary, the club’s ATC, prior to making his/her decision
regarding whether or not the player will return to the game.</p></ul>
<ul><p>4. If the Team Physician determines that the player shall not return to play (because
the signs or symptoms of concussion are apparent) and therefore there is no need
to conduct the initial (focused neurological) evaluation (e.g., based upon loss of
consciousness or other readily apparent criteria), the Team Physician may request
the UNC team member to accompany the player to the locker room to evaluate the
player for serious injury, treat the player or activate the EAP if indicated. </p></ul>
<h3>The NFL Is Not Doing Everything They Can To Prevent Concussions</h3>
<h4>Russell Wilson</h4>
<p>The NFL concussion protocol checklist seems like it will help prevent concussions. However sometimes it does the opposite of what it was designed to do. for example, last month Seatle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson was sent to the sideline by a referee out of fear that the quarterback had suffered a concussion. The sideline trainers did not have him cleared, and then put him back into the game, thus endangering him even more.</p>
<h4>Tom Savage</h4>
<p>Another example was more recent and much more serious. Houston Texans Quarterback Tom Savage suffered a massive hit and his head slammed against the turf. He laid on the ground with his arms in the air shaking like he was having a seizure. he was brought to the sideline and very obviously had a concussion. Savage was brought into the medical tent, and soon he was out and was sent back into the game. A short time after he came back to the sideline he was told by a coach to not go back into the game. The Trainers clearly didn't follow the protocol, or the prodigal just wasn't helping them identify a concussion so they let him go back in the game. After these events, the NFL recieved a good amount of hate from all over about their failure to protect players. The NFL is currently creating a new concussion protocol which is very necessary because players will suffer long term effects if the NFL doesn't do something. </p>
